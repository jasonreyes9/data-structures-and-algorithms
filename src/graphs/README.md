# Graphs

Different types of Graphs exist.

Three common ones:

- Undirected Graphs
- Directed Graphs
- Weighted Graphs

Graph consists of vertices and edges.

Vertices are simply nodes. They are the values.

Edges are the connections between the nodes.

To visualize, imagine roads connecting cities. The cities are the vertices and the roads are the edges.

Or friends on Facebook. The friends are the vertices and the connections are the edges.
