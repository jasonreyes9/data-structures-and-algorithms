# Stacks

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The is usually LIFO(Last In First Out).

You have add, remove and peek operations.

It is like a stack of books. You can only add a book to the top of the stack and you can only remove the top book from the stack.
