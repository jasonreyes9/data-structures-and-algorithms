# Queues

Queues are a data structure that follow the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first element removed from the queue. It is like a line at a grocery store, the first person in line will be the first person to be served.

It has the operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek, size and isEmpty.

This implementation uses JS arrays, but it is more efficient to use a linked lists, which is the typical implementation of a queue.
